## Running locally

Installing this Python package registers an entry point `vqe-playground`.
Running it starts a pygame based graphical interface.

## Running on CoCalc

You have to create an environment for graphical applications via an `*.x11` file,
see [Graphical Application](https://doc.cocalc.com/x11.html).
You can also open the file [cocalc.x11](./cocalc.x11), which launches this application automatically.
Otherwise, run `vqe-playground` in the terminal.
