# This initialization file is associated with your terminal in vqe-playground/..cocalc.x11-0.term.init.
# It is automatically run whenever it starts up -- restart the terminal via Ctrl-d and Return-key.

# Usually, your ~/.bashrc is executed and this behavior is emulated for completeness:
source ~/.bashrc
